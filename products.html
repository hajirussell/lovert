                        <h5>Basic Package</h5>

                        <p>With the Basic Package, we send a sales representative to your nearest geographical location.
                            It is up to you to make it to their traveling office, and, depending on your longitude,
                            might require the use of climbing equipment. Our representative will provide the comfort of
                            an office space if you require such mortal luxuries, beverages, light snacks, and all the
                            paperwork necessary to book the vacation of your dreams.
                        </p>
                        <p>There is no location that is off-limits, though, for our first-time clients, we suggest the
                            Mysterious Flesh Pit or the Liminal Space Emporium.
                        </p>

                        <p>We will walk you through the process of booking your own flight and hotel, though if you are
                            interested in our flight and hotel services, please see the Gold and Platinum Packages for
                            details.
                        </p>

                        <p>This package includes ground and boat based transportation, a variety of food packages for
                            families of all sizes, discount vouchers for local attractions, and a personal photographer
                            to capture every waking moment of your getaway. And you’ll be saying getaway a lot by the
                            time your vacation is over. Trust us.
                        </p>

                        <p>If you are interested in the Basic Package, please submit a contact request from the Contact
